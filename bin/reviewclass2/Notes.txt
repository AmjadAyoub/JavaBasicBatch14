type casting: is converting the type of data from one type to another one. We have 2 types of type casting
1- Explicit/narrowing/manual.
2- Implicit/widening/Automatic

from smallest to largest:
1. byte (8 bits) 2. short (16)  char (16) 3. int (32) 4. long (64) 5. float ( 32) 6. double (64)
( 3222   or  3.2E12 ) 3.2E12 = 3.2*1000000000000
so 3.2E12 > 3222   that is why float 32 bits is larger than long 64 bits.

Explicit
int box=1000;
byte box2=(byte)box;
System.out.println(box2);

Implicit
short largerbox1=129;
int smallerBox2=largerBox1;
System.out.println(smallerBox2);

If statements: if else conditions allow us to write programs that make decisions based on some condition and provided data.
if condition
if else condition
if else if condition
nested if else condition


What is the syntax of if else condition?
if condition

boolean rich=true;
if(rich)
{
System.out.println("let us buy a jet");
} else { System.out.println("let us buy a car");
